# Welcome!

This is going to be a rapid orientation to software containerization through a series of examples.

The only assumptions are that you are a software developer with a basic familiarity using a bash shell in a terminal and that your environment has the following software installed to get through most of this guide:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* curl \([Windows](https://curl.se/windows/); probably already pre-installed on [Linux](https://curl.se/download.html) and [macOS](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/curl)\)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't want to install these tools on your own machine, then you can use [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell). It provides a cloud-hosted environment that has all the tools you'll need already installed.
{% endhint %}

Don't worry about it now, but later on you will probably also want the following tools \(and these are also already installed on Google Cloud Shell\):

* [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) \(`gcloud`\)
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

Let's jump right in!
